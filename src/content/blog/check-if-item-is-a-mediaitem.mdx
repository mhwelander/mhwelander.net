You can check if an item is a media item by using:

```csharp
item.Paths.IsMediaItem
```

It checks if ‘media library’ is part of the item’s path.

I had a multilist of items that could be either regular content items or media items, and needed to loop through and render a link for each one. Because you use different methods to render a MediaItem link (`MediaManager.GetMediaUrl()`) and regular item link (`LinkManager.GetImageUrl()`), I needed to know what type the item was.

Hi Martina,

Sitecore.Data.ItemPath — items.Paths is an instance of this class — has another similar property for content items: IsContentItem. This helps calling code ascertain if the item is a descendant of /sitecore/content/.

Hi,

The property IsMediaItem just checks if the path starts with “/sitecore/media library/”. So a media folder within the media library is also considered a MediaItem. I handled this by also checking on TemplateID:

item.Paths.IsMediaItem && item.TemplateID != TemplateIDs.MediaFolder
