I'm pretty sure I know what **cookies** are, and how they work. But I'm _also_ pretty sure I know what a **cat** looks like, and yet, drawing one without reference results in.. something less than ideal:

So I did some research. This post is for anyone with passing knowledge of cookies who really wants to get into the crumbs.

## First of all: What is the point of a cookie?

A cookie is a way to **uniquely identify** a person **between page requests** (going from one page to another) and **between sessions** (visiting a site on Monday, and then on Friday). Here is how the internet works without cookies (if we assume that [cookies are the only way to uniquely identify a person](#), which is not strictly true):

* You visit a website about birds
* You look at a page about pidgeons
* You look at a page about hawks
* Three days later, you open your browser again and visit a page about peregrine falcons

Without cookies, there is **no way to know that these requests came from the same person**. I can't track your path through the website or how long you spent, or that you had two sessions.

It's all just 'hits', like in the olden days of hit counters.

With cookies:

* You visit website about birds, and it ends you a cookie that is unique to you
* You look at a page about pidgeons - it knows about the cookie
* You look at page about hawks - it knows about the cookie
* Three days later, you open your browser again and visit a page about peregrine falcons - it, too, knows about the cookie

## Who cares?

Why is that important? Tracking, personalization.. 'a human from Colorado visited pages about birds' is not possible without a cookie (or some other identifier). The best you can do without a cookie is to say 'people visited the pidgeon page'. 

## You get a cookie, and you get a cookie!

When you request a web page - let's say, `mhwelander.net` - that web page sends you a **response**. That response contains all the pieces of text required to display the page: HTML, CSS, scripts, images, fonts - and **cookies**, although you (and many legislative bodies) could argue that cookies are an _optional_ part of a healthy diet.

You can see this happening in [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools). Click `Option + âŒ˜ + I` (Mac) or `F12` (Windows), then click on the **Network** tab and refresh your page. Notice that the response from `mhwelander.net` includes various requests to get fonts, stylesheets, and script files:

## But where be the cookies?

Although cookies are not on that list on an obvious way (websites are not sending `23dDie8abc303.cookie` files), _one or more of the requests in that list_ is **delivering cookies to your browser**:

[Highlight things that could be setting cookies]

 You can see the cookies your browser has stored for a particular site in **Application** tab of the Chrome Developer Tools, under **Storage > Cookies > [yourwebsite]**:

For example, the contents of my `_ga` cookie is `GA1.1.748647506.1724449994` - tasty stuff. Your browser then **stores** those cookies until:

* They expire
* You delete them
* A script on the website (such as a cookie consent banner) deletes them - or at least the ones [that a script is capable of deleting](#)

## Exactly how are cookies being delivered?

If websites are not sending you `*.cookie` files, then how do they make? You can receive a cookie from a website in two ways:

* In the HTTP response header (so fancy)
* Set by some Javascript

### Set by Javascript

### Set by the HTTP response header

## So I've caught cookies. What are they used for?

## Domain matters: First party and third party cookies

http response header - set third party cookie

### Why does the Google Analytics script say mhwelander.net and not google.com?
