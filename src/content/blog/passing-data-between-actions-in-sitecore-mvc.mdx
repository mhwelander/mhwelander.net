In standard ASP.NET MVC, you may be accustomed to seeing `RedirectToAction`. This allows you to specify a controller and action to redirect to, as well as any additional parameters you might want to pass along. In the following example, the `VoteForCar` action (which is triggered by submitting a form post) performs some voting logic, and then redirects to a generic `Confirmation` action (to which it also passes an `id` parameter). This action returns a thank-you view with additional fun facts about the car that you just voted for, which it retrieves using the ID that the `RedirectToAction` supplied.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult VoteForCar(int id, string voterName) {
     
    // Voting logic
 
    RedirectToAction("Confirmation", new { carID = id });
}
 
public ActionResult Confirmation(int carID) {
 
    var fact = GetRandomFunFact(carID);
 
    return View(fact);
}
```

## But you can't use RedirectToAction in Sitecore

In Sitecore, you cannot use `RedirectToAction`. If `VoteForCar` was a controller rendering action, you might think that using `RedirectToAction` would simply refresh the page and change the output of that particular controller rendering to the result of the `Confirmation`. This is not the case. Instead, using `RedirectToAction` will interrupt the rendering of the Sitecore page and take you to the plain ASP.NET MVC view being output by the `Confirmation` action.

However, you *can* still use `RedirectToRoute` -- and it is possible to pass along parameters in exactly the same way.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult VoteForCar(int id, string voterName) {
     
    // Voting logic
 
    var options = new UrlOptions
    {
        AddAspxExtension = false,
        LanguageEmbedding = LanguageEmbedding.Never
    };
 
    var pathInfo = (LinkManager.GetItemUrl(Sitecore.Context.Database.GetItem(new ID("{81B81009-4C09-4D31-88A0-4486A7FE35E0}")), options));
 
        return RedirectToRoute(MvcSettings.SitecoreRouteName, new { pathInfo = pathInfo.TrimStart(new char[] { '/' }), carID = id });
    }
}
```

At the very least, `RedirectToRoute` requires `pathInfo` to be set to the URL of the Sitecore item that you wish to redirect to. I have removed the `.aspx` extension and language embedding using `UrlOptions`, but you can change these settings globally on the `linkManager` in `web.config` instead.

Keep in mind that any controller rendering on the page that you are redirecting to will be able to access the `carID` parameter. Let's say you have a 'Confirmation' controller rendering that maps to the `Confirmation` action result. If there is a `carID` in the query string, it will output a fun fact about the car you selected -- if not, it will just say 'Thank you for voting!'.

But what happens if an editor -- using the Page Editor -- adds an additional component to the confirmation page, and it *also* relies on a `carID` parameter -- but for different reasons? Doesn't matter -- the new component detects that `carID` exists in the query string and uses it anyway.

Given that you cannot predict which components will appear on a page, it is probably wise to give your parameter a more unique name:

```csharp
public ActionResult Confirmation(int carFunFactID) {
 
    var fact = GetRandomFunFact(carID);
 
    return View(fact);
}
```

You should also make sure that your action result is able to cope with a null or empty value.

## What kind of values can I pass between actions?

Just like in regular ASP.NET MVC, you cannot pass complex types -- like complete models -- between actions. `RedirectToRoute` is a redirect, and basically acts as a plain old `HTTP GET` -- with `?carID=434` in the URL.

I have a rendering which is a form. When the form is submitted I need to validate the model. If the model is invalid then I need to show the form with the error state. If the model is valid then I need to go to a different page.

I can do this in plain asp.net MVC, but I cannot wrap my head around how it will be architected in sitecore?

I tried with a controller rendering and upon post back it just displays the form view. The whole layout and other renderings are gone.

Hello -- Sitecore MVC forms don't behave in quite the same way; have a read of this: [Posting forms in Sitecore MVC (Part 2) – Controller Renderings](posting-forms-in-sitecore-mvc-part-2-controller-renderings)

And also this, which might be closer to the scenario you have: https://ctor.io/posting-forms-in-sitecore-controller-renderings-another-perspective
