I work with a team of **30+** developers and QA on a large platform. For the most part, I write the documentation by **reverse engineering** a feature and acting as its first **external consumer**. This is a good way of sanity checking design and architecture as well as learning how something works.

However:

-   Code does not always capture **intent**. Why something was designed a certain way – especially if deadlines mean that you have to opt for a **minimum viable solution** – makes a huge difference to the documentation.
-   Code tells you nothing about **business requirements** and the delineation between **features** is not always obvious.
-   Not all work results in code – for example, scalability testing might results in a set of  **recommended practices**.

Here are four **development practices** that can benefit the documentation. In our organisation, these are either enforced by the tools or the project manager.

## A task for everything, and for everything a task

Every piece of work must be captured as a **product backlog item** (PBI), **task**, or **bug** in the project tracking system (such as JIRA or Microsoft TFS).

-   The developers cannot start a piece of work until a task exists
-   All tasks are related to a specific feature area
-   All commits and pull request must be linked to a task – this is enforced in the UI

This creates a **comprehensive paper trail** and links every code change to a task with a title and a description. The writer can use the task list as a starting point for the documentation and feel confident that it accurately reflects the work that was done.

## Detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria

**Acceptance criteria** are used by QA to plan tests, and is usually a very detailed list of expected behaviour – e.g. “If you try to save an object with a special character in the title, you will get a NoSpecialCharactersException”.

The most useful **descriptions** contain **business requirement** and any **key decisions** that were made – particularly if they were made during an offline meeting

Detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria tell you how a feature is expected to work and where the requirement came from. It is the best place to get **business context** for a task if you cannot speak to the developer or product owner.

## Unit and integration tests

Unit and integration tests are a great way to see the **acceptance criteria in action**, and are a virtual gold mine for **code samples**. Use tests to get a sense of how a feature or an API should be used.

**Tip:** If your team uses [SpecFlow](http://specflow.org/), test scenarios are defined in a very easy-to-read format.

## Tag breaking changes

This practice is particularly useful for **release notes** and for updating documentation that has already been written. Whenever a task or bug results in a breaking change to existing documentation, it gets a **\[breaking changes\]** tag.
