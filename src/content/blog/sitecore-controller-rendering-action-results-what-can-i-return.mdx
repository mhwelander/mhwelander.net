Sitecore controller rendering action results â€“ what can I return?

The two main (though by no means only) renderings available in Sitecore MVC areÂ **view**Â andÂ **controller**Â renderings.

A view rendering only requires a references to a .cshtml file â€“ Sitecore returns the model (the default RenderingModel or one of your choosing â€“Â [see part 2 of the Sitecore MVC video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW_rQp9bMmE)Â for more information). A controller rendering requires you to specify a controller name and an action, the result of which is then rendered to the page.

In standard ASP.NET MVC, an action result can be any number of things â€“ a standard view, but also JSON, content, or an empty result. In this post I will explain which ones you can use in the context of a controller rendering, and why.

## A look at the Sitecore MVC execution lifecycle

Although there is nothing special about the controller you create to use with a controller rendering, the point at which that code is executed differs from the norm.

Letâ€™s say you have a page with 1 view rendering and 1 controller rendering. The Sitecore.MVC.config file in /App\_Config/Include gives you a clue as to what happens when a request â€“ e.g. /cars/mitsubishi-lancer-evo-xi), the Index() action â€“ comes in.

In the section markedÂ , the Sitecore controller is instantiated, and model binding forÂ _view renderings_Â occurs. This is the pipeline calledÂ .

By the time we get to theÂ , we are already in theÂ Â section of the pipeline. By the time we come to rendering out the actualÂ _renderings_, the page has already started to render out â€“ which means that any action results returned byÂ **controller renderings**Â are taking placeÂ _after_Â the main controller has executed.

## How does this affect what you can return as an action result from a controller rendering?

A controller rendering is still a rendering. This means that anything the specified action returns must beÂ **visual content**Â of some kind, because part of the page it belongs to has already been rendered.

### ViewResult (View()) and PartialViewResult (PartialView())

ViewResultÂ is the most commonÂ ActionResultÂ to return â€“ Sitecore copes fine with eitherÂ `ViewResult`Â orÂ `PartialViewResult`.

### ContentResult (Content())

If you were to return the following string as aÂ ContentResult, Page Editor functionality (both inline editing and the ability to change the componentâ€™s datasource) will remain intact:

```csharp
var text = FieldRenderer.Render(RenderingContext.Current.Rendering.Item, "Text");
return Content(text);
```

### EmptyResult

If you return anÂ EmptyResult, Sitecore will behave as though the rendering does not exist. If the only rendering assigned to a particular placeholder returnsÂ EmptyResult, that placeholder will appear to be empty.

This might be useful if you want a hide a rendering that does not have an appropriate datasource assigned. However, be careful not to returnÂ EmptyResultÂ in Page Editor mode, as the editor will not be able to select it to edit their mistake.

### JSONResult (JSON()) or JavascriptResult (Javacript())

NeitherÂ `JSON()`Â norÂ `Javascript()`Â can be returned from a controller rendering action. Returning this type ofÂ ActionResultÂ will cause your entire page â€“ including the Page Editor HTML â€“ to be returned as plain text.

### RedirectToAction

In standard ASP.NET MVC, you might useÂ `*RedirectToAction`Â in the following way:

```csharp
public ActionResult GetProduct(int productID)
{
    var product = _productRepository.GetProduct(productID);
 
    if (product == null)
    {
        return RedirectToAction("MissingProduct", new { productID = productID } );
    }
 
    return View(product);
}
 
// Returns an error view if product does not exist
public ActionResult NoProduct(int productID)
{
    return View(productID);
}
```

In the above example, if no product is found, a separateÂ ActionResultÂ is responsible for dealing with what the user should see. This avoids littering each `ActionResult` withÂ ifÂ statements, and makes them reusable.

In a Sitecore context,Â GetProductÂ would map to a controller rendering. It would be one of several renderings on a page. You would expectÂ RedirectToActionÂ to affect the contents of that renderingÂ _only_, but unfortunately this is not the case. It is still a redirect, and if you try to use it in a Sitecore context it will redirectÂ _your entire page_Â to a standard MVC route. For example, if you are onÂ **/cars/mitsubishi-lancer-evo-xi**Â and any of the controller renderings performs aÂ RedirectToActionÂ as shown above, you will be toÂ /Cars/NoProductÂ instead.

Consider returning different views within your initialÂ `ActionResult`Â instead:

```csharp
public ActionResult GetProduct(int productID)
{
    var product = _productRepository.GetProduct(productID);
 
    if (product == null)
    {
        return View("~/shared/errors/_NoProduct.cshtml");
    }
 
    return View(product);
}
```

### RedirectToRoute

`RedirectToRoute`Â does work, but you will want to redirect to Sitecoreâ€™s default route, which looks like this:

```csharp
RouteTable.Routes.MapRoute( 
  Sitecore.Mvc.Configuration.MvcSettings.SitecoreRouteName,  
  "{*pathInfo}",  
  new { scIsFallThrough = true },  
  new { isContent = new Sitecore.Mvc.Presentation.IsContentUrlRestraint() });
```

And to use it:

```csharp
UrlOptions options = new UrlOptions {
        AddAspxExtension = false
    };

    var url = LinkManager.GetItemUrl(item, options);

    var trimmedUrl = url.TrimStart(new char[] { '/' });

    return RedirectToRoute(
            MvcSettings.SitecoreRouteName,
            new { pathInfo = trimmedUrl });
```

### FileResult (File())

If you try to return a file in a renderingâ€™sÂ ActionResult, you will get this error.

```
OutputStream is not available when a custom TextWriter is used
```

By the time we reach the rendering attempting to return a file stream, the page has already started rendering. If you want to return a file, use a custom route andÂ RedirectToAction.

## In summary

It is important to remember that in a Sitecore context, controller actions map to aÂ **rendering**, and by the time we come to execute these action results, much of the page will already have been rendered. Whatever they return needs to be something that can be displayed on screen, or a redirect.

Hi,

Nice post. I have one question on this part that how the HttpPost will be handled when using View Renderings or Controller Renderings.

Cheers to this post.

Hello --

That's actually the topic of my next MVC video! ðŸ™‚ I'll summarize briefly how you actually do a post:

Controller renderings will listen to [HttpPost] and [HttpGet], so if you post from a controller rendering (without specifying a custom route -- that's a different scenario), it will execute the same action, but look for the [HttpPost] version.

However, if you have more than one rendering containing a form on a single Sitecore page, they will *all* post regardless of which button you click -- so you might need to check, in each one, which rendering the post is originating from.

(You could also do an AJAX post and not have to worry about that.)

View renderings have a post controller and action field on the definition item -- any post from a view rendering will go to whatever you have specified. I do not know if it will post all forms on the page, though.

is there somewhere an example on how to return a (pdf) file to the browser through sitecore?

Pardon the delay! From the media library? There's an explanation here of how to get the media itme URL:Â http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11036843/link-to-sitecore-media-item

What about a generated PDF file? I.e., can you please provide more details regarding "If you want to return a file, use a custom route and RedirectToAction."
